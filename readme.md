- Implement rabbitmq cluster.
- Each publisher send message to consumer of the same network and the rabbitmq cluster.
- Introduce block circular replication mechanism that use DB hostname and sql command to check data existance.
- Develop API and RabbitMQ perf script.

- Extract producer and consumer in rabbitmq-client container.
- Each producer write in all consumer except his own and each consumer write only on his database.
- Add support for UPDATE operation.
- Make rabbitmq cluster with disk mode.
- Each rabbitmq node has it's own queue and related producer/consumer communicate throug that queue.
- Add third network/VM
- Update architecture schema.
